Water and Energy Supply and Consumption info model - A data standard for water and energy supply and consumption

##About 

The Water and Energy Supply and Consumption (WESC) data standard has been developed by CSIRO to support a common represention of data for supply and consumption of water and energy and its delivery via standardised OGC services.

The information model allows for data to be delivered in a consistent format and is the basis for the exchange format (XML schemas) for encoding datasets.

A key component of WESC is the set of agreed and shared vocabularies used to encode the content for each XML instance, such as result method used to measure a meter reading and units of measure.
